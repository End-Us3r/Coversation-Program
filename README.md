# Coversation-Program

This is a Java program that has a conversation with the user. It prompts the user to input something about themselves and responds with one of four different possible statements, chosen based on a "random" number generated from the length of the user's input. The program uses a Scanner object to read the user's input and a while loop to continue the conversation until the user enters "Goodbye".
